### Understanding the Aggregation Pipeline and the Fields

To understand how the MongoDB aggregation pipeline works in your code, let's break down the specific parts in question.

### What `$subscribers` Returns

In your `$lookup` stage, you are joining the `subscriptions` collection with the `User` collection:

```javascript
{
    $lookup: {
        from: "subscriptions",
        localField: "_id",
        foreignField: "channel",
        as: "subscribers"
    }
}
```

This `lookup` stage will result in adding an array field named `subscribers` to each `User` document. This array will contain all the documents from the `subscriptions` collection where the `channel` field matches the `_id` of the `User` document.

Given your `subscriptions` collection structure:

```javascript
subscribers = [
    { subscriber: "", channel: "" },
    { subscriber: "", channel: "" },
    { subscriber: "", channel: "" },
    { subscriber: "", channel: "" },
    ...
]
```

### What `{ $size: "$subscribers" }` Returns

The `$size` operator returns the number of elements in an array. 

```javascript
$addFields: {
    subscribersCount: { $size: "$subscribers" }
}
```

Here, `"$subscribers"` refers to the array of documents from the `subscriptions` collection that were joined to the `User` document. The expression `{ $size: "$subscribers" }` calculates the number of documents in this array, effectively counting how many subscribers the channel has. This count is stored in the `subscribersCount` field.

### How `$in: [req.user._id, "$subscribers.subscriber"]` Works

The `$in` operator checks if a specified value is in an array.

```javascript
isSubscribed: {
    $in: [req.user._id, "$subscribers.subscriber"]
}
```

Here, `"$subscribers.subscriber"` refers to the `subscriber` field in each document within the `subscribers` array. This array will look like:

```javascript
[
    { subscriber: "user1", channel: "channel1" },
    { subscriber: "user2", channel: "channel1" },
    { subscriber: "user3", channel: "channel1" },
    ...
]
```

The `$in` operator checks if the `req.user._id` (the ID of the currently authenticated user) is present in the array of `subscriber` values from the `subscribers` array. 

### What `$subscribers.subscriber` Returns or Equals To

In the context of the `$in` operator, `"$subscribers.subscriber"` returns an array of all `subscriber` values from the `subscribers` array of documents. For example, if your `subscribers` array looks like this:

```javascript
subscribers = [
    { subscriber: "user1", channel: "channel1" },
    { subscriber: "user2", channel: "channel1" },
    { subscriber: "user3", channel: "channel1" },
    ...
]
```

Then `"$subscribers.subscriber"` will return:

```javascript
["user1", "user2", "user3", ...]
```

### Summary of Each Part

- **`$subscribers`**: Refers to the array of joined documents from the `subscriptions` collection where `channel` matches the `_id` of the `User`.
- **`{ $size: "$subscribers" }`**: Calculates the number of documents in the `subscribers` array, returning the total count of subscribers for the channel.
- **`$in: [req.user._id, "$subscribers.subscriber"]`**: Checks if the current user's ID (`req.user._id`) is present in the array of `subscriber` IDs from the `subscribers` array, determining if the current user is subscribed to the channel.
- **`$subscribers.subscriber`**: Returns an array of all `subscriber` IDs from the `subscribers` array.

These operations together help you gather detailed information about a user's channel profile, including how many subscribers they have, how many channels they are subscribed to, and whether the currently authenticated user is subscribed to their channel.
